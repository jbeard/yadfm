Text Will Be Text 2.02

I wrote this small plugin for myself because I was tired seeing coffins instead of zeroes and all that stuff. It allows to specify separate fonts for map tiles and for text. GRAPHICS_FONT/GRAPHICS_FULLFONT will continue to be used for map area(s), and FONT/FULLFONT will be used for everything else. Requires OpenGL PRINT_MODE (STANDARD, VBO and so on). Adventurer mode and possibly some other screens need some more work.

Also it allows to override tile numbers for buildings and items, see overrides.txt for details.
