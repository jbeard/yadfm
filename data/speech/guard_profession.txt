I am a guard.
I guard this place from hostile intruders.
I protect this place.
I keep troublemakers from making too much trouble.
I defend this land from any foe.
I fight so that others may live.
I wait for battle.
I fight for a living.
I do have a knack for killing things.
I am indeed.
I am proud of it.
I worked hard to become one.
I have always been a warrior at heart.
My duty is to protect this place from invaders.
