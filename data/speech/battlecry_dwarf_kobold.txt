The dwarf yells: A thief! Get the little bugger!
The dwarf yells: Kobolds are in the fort. Drive them out!
The dwarf yells: After it. Dont let it get away with our gems. Or worst, the booze!
The dwarf yells: Oh, it's cute. I almost dont want to kill it.
The dwarf yells: Pff, a kitten could kill this bold.
The dwarf yells: Run, run as fast as your little feet can carry you! And don't come back, you hear?
The dwarf yells: Look, I think it wants to steal Urists socks.
The dwarf yells: What the...? Is he carrying away Urists magical artefact mug? Good riddance, I say.
The dwarf yells: Gobshite! Another one of those little thieves!
The dwarf yells: Smashing, more combat training ahead.
The dwarf yells: A wee bit cocky, aren't we? Think you can take me on all by yourself?
The dwarf yells: Hey, you wanker. Get over here! Yes, panicked looking kobold, I am talking to you.
The dwarf yells: You will regret the day you left your mothers womb!
The dwarf yells: Taste my axe. Regarldess of me actually wielding an axe or not.
The dwarf yells: By Armoks beard, kobold, today is not your day, believe me.
The dwarf yells: You and your tiny bollocks can crawl back into the hole they come from.
