The dwarf yells: Die, traitor!
The dwarf yells: Raise your glass to Armok, for today you die!
The dwarf yells: I regret that I must do this, my bearded brother!
The dwarf yells: He must be stark raving mad to go on about like that. I have to put him down.
The dwarf yells: Armok, please forgive me, but I have to kill this bearded son of a bitch.
The dwarf yells: Die! You have forgotten Armok!
The dwarf yells: Chaos cannot save you!
The dwarf yells: Down with the false beards!
The dwarf yells: Get them! Let none escape! The chaos dwarves will die today!

The dwarf yells: Taste my axe. Regarldess of me actually wielding an axe or not.
The dwarf yells: By Armoks beard, today is not your day, believe me.
