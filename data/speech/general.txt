whose cries for mercy went unheeded by my wrath
whose insignificant name I struggle to recall
a spineless slug whom was crushed under my might
whom I buried alive under a mountain of hatred
who lies dead, now only an embarrassing memory
who sought my praise, only to be rejected in death
once revered by those who didn't know any better
who scurried away from me like a wounded hare
who barely had the strength to lift [PRO_POS] own arms
whose entrails covered the floor
whose skull now lies in pieces
whose life was snuffed out like an old candle
whose bones you now stand on
who was a fool to have stood before me
who cowered before me in terror
who begged for mercy as I laughed in [PRO_POS] face
who cried like a babe at my approach
who tried in vain to outrun me
who wore my hand around [PRO_POS] throat
whose bones you now stand on
who was once too stupid to live
who made the mistake of angering me
