Don't start any trouble.
I'll be watching for problems.
These are good people.  Be good to them.
I would give my life for this land.
Behave yourself.
Keep your weapons down while you're here.
Keep your hands to yourself.
I keep this place safe.
Mind yourself.
I'm bored.
I hate patrol duty.
I can't stand this place.
I wonder what time it is.
If you start any trouble, you won't be finishing it.
Don't make me dirty this land with your blood.
What are you looking at?
Don't make me angry.
Go away.
Leave me be.
We have nothing to discuss.
Let me know if you need any assistance.
What can I do for you?
Do I know you?
Got anything to drink?
