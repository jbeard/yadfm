upon arising in the mornings,
when going on a long journey,
before retiring in the evening,
as sure as I am here now,
and lo,
it cannot be said enough;
these are dangerous times, so
I say again
yes,
before every meal,
whenever the tide turns,
when you return to this place,
when you arrive at your destination,
at this juncture in your life,
and so I say to you,
as always,
please, before you go,
I have to tell you,
remember this:
my fellow seeker,
I besiege you:
if you know what is good for you,
as surely as I stand before you now,
behold:
hear this, and never forget:
